        1. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation. [Newsletter](img/tester_stories_screenshots/form.jpg)

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The main colours used are black, cream, and yellow provided by bootstrap.
    -   #### Typography
        -    I used the default bootstrap font-family "Righteous". The font is used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I think this font is a clean and it is used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background images are designed to be striking and catch the user's attention.
